K8s objects - Persistent entities in k8s that define the desired state for your workloads
    Pod
        Simplest unit in k8s
        Represents processes running in your cluster
        Encapsulates a container (or sometimes multiple)
        Replicating a Pod to scale an app horizontally
    ReplicaSet
        Maintains a set of identical Pods
        Definition consists of:
            Number of replicas
            Pod Template
            Generally encapsulated by a Deployment object
    namespaces
        Virtualization of a physical cluster
        Segregate cluster by team, project, etc.
        Necessary with large number of users
        Logical separation for clusters
            1. kube-system
                Intended for the k8s system
            2. default
                Can be used to hold users' apps
            3. <opt> create more namespaces for teams, projects, etc within a cluster.
        Provide a scope for object names
            Each object has a name
            Names are unique for a resource type within a namespace
    Deployments
        Provides updates for Pods and ReplicaSets
        Runs multiple replicas of your application
        Suitable for stateless applications
        Update triggers a rollout
    ConfigMaps
    volumes
Parts of the Object:
    1. spec - provided by the user (desired state for the object)
    2. status - provided by k8s (describes the actual states)

Labels
    key/value pairs attached to objects to identify them
    Not unique
    Organize and group objects with the same label
Selectors
    Identify and group a set of objects
